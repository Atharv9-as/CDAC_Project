NEO - 6M :- 

The NEO-6M GPS module, it comes with an external antenna.
It provides location, speed, and time data.
Accurate data - It provides real-time data including latitude, longitude, altitude, and speed.

// performance => high performance , it can track upto 22 satellites on 50 channels

It supports UART communication.


Power supply: 3V to 5V
Operating Temperature :- -40C to 85C

It has four pins VCC, RX, TX, GND
	VCC =>	5v
	RX => TX pin uc 
	TX => RX pin uc
	GND => GND
	
Internal EEPROM: Retains configuration settings even after a power down.
	
How it works :-
The internal ceramic antenna receives signals from GPS satellites.
It determines its precise latitude, longitude, and altitude.
It sends this data to a connected microcontroller via the UART (TX/RX) pins.
